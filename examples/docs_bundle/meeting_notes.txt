Meeting notes (Jan 10):
- Idea: self-serve analytics for Shopify merchants
- Must set up in <10 minutes via Shopify app install
- Personas: Growth manager, Marketing manager
- Pain: unclear funnel drop-offs, attribution, cohort retention
- Non-goal: full data warehouse; focus on insights + action
- Privacy: data retention controls; PII minimization
