Discovery session – AI underwriting platform

Participants: Head of Credit, Ops Lead, Product, Engineering

- Goal is to reduce underwriting TAT from days to minutes
- Current process is heavily manual, rule-based + spreadsheets
- Analysts pull data from multiple sources: bank statements, credit bureaus, KYC docs
- Desire to introduce AI agents that can:
  - Pre-screen applications
  - Flag risk factors
  - Recommend approve / reject / manual review
- Humans must stay in the loop for high-risk loans
- Need explainability for every decision
- Regulators will audit decisions
- Initial focus on SME loans, not retail credit cards
- Non-goal: fully autonomous approval in phase 1
- Need configurable risk policies per lender
- Integration with existing LOS systems is mandatory
- Latency matters — decisions should be near real-time
