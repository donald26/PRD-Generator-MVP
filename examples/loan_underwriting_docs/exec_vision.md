# Executive Vision – AI Underwriting Platform

We aim to build a modern underwriting platform that leverages AI agents to augment human underwriters, not replace them.

The platform should:
- Improve speed, consistency, and scalability of underwriting
- Reduce operational costs per loan
- Enable lenders to adapt risk policies quickly
- Provide full transparency into decision rationale

Success will be measured by:
- Reduction in average underwriting time
- Reduction in manual effort per application
- Improved approval consistency across analysts

The platform must be enterprise-ready:
- Secure by default
- Auditable
- Compliant with financial regulations

Longer term, this platform can expand beyond underwriting into portfolio monitoring and risk management.
