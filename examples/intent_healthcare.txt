Build a mobile-first appointment scheduling product for multi-location dental clinics.
Key goals:
- Reduce no-shows with reminders and easy rescheduling
- Support insurance pre-check workflows
- Provide a staff dashboard for schedule optimization
Constraints:
- HIPAA-adjacent privacy expectations
- Multi-tenant (each clinic group isolated)
