### Product Intent
Industry Blueprints are pre-packaged, installable Accenture intelligence and workflow solutions tailored for specific industries. They encapsulate decades of industry best practices in the form of Nemotron Open Models (SLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Bases (RAGs). Customers can quickly deploy industry-specific workflows that function out-of-the-box, while retaining full customization options within the platform's Workflow Designer. The NVIDIA Stack enhances execution efficiency and scalability, enabling high-throughput, low-latency, and enterprise-grade AI runtimes.

### Key Facts
1. **Industry Blueprints**: Deployable, versioned packages of workflows, models, and knowledge artifacts.
2. **Accenture Domain Expertise**: Fine-tuned Nemotron Open Models (SLMs) and RAGs.
3. **GPU-Accelerated Execution**: NVIDIA stack for high-performance and compliance.
4. **Out-of-the-Box Functionality**: Pre-built workflows and AI logic.
5. **Customizable Solutions**: Fully customizable within the platform.
6. **Orchestration Platform Integration**: Natively integrated capability within the Workflow Orchestration Platform.
7. **NVIDIA Stack Enablement**: Initial support for NVIDIA-accelerated environments.

### Constraints
1. **Initial NVIDIA Support**: Only initial enablement for NVIDIA-accelerated environments.
2. **Performance and Compliance**: High-throughput, low-latency, and enterprise-grade runtimes.
3. **Regulated Environments**: Ensure deterministic execution and model IP protection.

### Open Questions
1. **Future NVIDIA Enablement**: Will there be future support for non-NVIDIA environments?
2. **Scalability**: How does the platform scale beyond initial use cases?
3. **Customer Adoption**: Will customers find it easy to adopt and customize Industry Blueprints?
