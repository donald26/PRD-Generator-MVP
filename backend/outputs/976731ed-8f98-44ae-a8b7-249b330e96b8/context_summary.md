## Problem / Opportunity
Industry Blueprints provide pre-packaged, installable Accenture intelligence and workflow solutions tailored to specific industries. These blueprints encapsulate decades of industry best practices in the form of fine-tuned Nemotron Open Models (SLMs), retrieval-augmented knowledge bases (RAG), and ready-to-use workflow templates that work together as a cohesive solution. They enable customers to rapidly deploy industry-specific workflows that function out-of-the-box while remaining fully customizable within the platform's Workflow Designer.

## Goals
- Accelerate customer onboarding and adoption through pre-built industry solutions
- Enable repeatable, scalable delivery of domain expertise across customers
- Position the platform as industry-aware, not just workflow-capable

## Non-Goals
- None explicitly defined in documents

## Target Personas / Users
- Customers: End-users who need pre-built industry solutions to deploy workflows quickly and efficiently
- Product Owners: Stakeholders responsible for defining and delivering industry-specific solutions

## Key Functional Requirements
- Installable, versioned industry solutions
- Deep customization without breaking baseline best practices
- Support multiple intelligence delivery patterns (SLM + RAG)
- Workflows that work with default data and progressively adopt customer data

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Technical Constraints: None specified
- Business Constraints: None specified
- Assumptions: Industry Blueprints combine Accenture domain expertise with pre-built intelligence and workflows to reduce customer effort, accelerate time to value, and deliver reliable, scalable outcomes. NVIDIA Stack enablement ensures high-throughput, low-latency, and enterprise-grade AI runtimes, enhancing execution efficiency and scalability without altering the logical design of Industry Blueprints.
